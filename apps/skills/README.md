# Skills

Vue app with interactive demos of some of my skills.

## Structure

[pages](./src/pages) is the starting point for each page of the app. Some pages define
page-components under `./src/pages/{page}/components`. All general-use components
are under [components](./src/components/).

## Pages

[All](./src/pages/all-page/)

## Running the app:

From anywhere:  
`rush dev --to skills`

From this directory:  
`npm run dev`

## Running tests:

From anywhere:  
`rush test:nowatch`

From this directory:  
`npm run test`
