# Disclaimer

None of the code under `components/web-components-wrapper-nextjs/src/react-server-dom-webpack` belongs to me. This is sourced from [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) itself which is licensed under MIT at this time. I have included a copy of the license [here](./LICENSE.md).

However, I have made superficial modifications to these files such as removing the Typescript bindings and changing the file extensions.
